    <h3>Laura Zhou (BF 2022)</h3>
    <p>Laura is a junior in Benjamin Franklin College. She's majoring in physics, and potentially as well in electrical engineering. Her research interests lie broadly in AMO and quantum information. In her free time, you can find her drawing, reading manga, and hopelessly trying to develop a green thumb.

        <h3>Amanda Butler (JE 2022)</h3>
        <p>Amanda is a junior double majoring in Physics and Astronomy. She’s really excited to join the SPS board for this upcoming year, and looks forward to finding new ways of connecting Yale’s awesome physics resources with the greater campus community. During the few moments when she’s not doing p-sets, you can find Amanda cooking an unnecessary number of egg dishes, procrastinating via playlists, napping, or spontaneously beatboxing in the middle of conversations.

        <h3>Giovanna Truong (MY 2023)</h3>
        <p>Outreach Co-Chair Giovanna is a sophomore this year. She is a juggler and a cartoonist, and she met everyone in the Physics Department through her work in the Yale Daily News. She is also a proud/the only member of Harris Labs Midwest. She loves, in addition to learning physics and talking to people, printing at the JE Press — but she would love it more if she could find any umlauts!

        <p>Dawson is a rising sophomore in Ezra Stiles College (Go Moose!). He is a prospective physics or physics and mathematics major. He's from the Atlanta, GA area, which is where he will be doing his online classes this fall. In his spare time, his hobbies include music, hiking, and reading. He's super excited to serve as your SPS co-outreach chair, and he's aiming to increase involvement from younger classes and to help SPS share the joy of physics with our broader communities. Feel free to reach out with ideas and suggestions! He's looking forward to making the absolute most of this unique semester with y'all!
